## Project Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`)**: The foundation of the calculator, defining the structure and layout.
- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Handles the styling, giving the calculator its polished look.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**: The brain behind the calculator, implementing functionality.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure

The HTML defines three key areas:

1. **Screen**: Displays the entered numbers and results.
2. **Controls**: Contains buttons for numbers, operations, and special functions.
3. **Footer**: Includes copyright information and a GitHub link.

### CSS Styling

The CSS (linked externally) ensures the interface is visually appealing, responsive, and consistent across devices.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) brings life to the calculator with:

1. **Dynamic Button Generation**
    
    Buttons are created dynamically based on predefined values for flexibility.
    
2. **Operation Handling**
    
    Functions like `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` compute results, while `operate` coordinates these operations based on user input.
    
3. **Input Validation**
    
    Logic prevents invalid input, such as multiple operators in a row or division by zero.
    
4. **Keyboard Interaction**
    
    Keypress events replicate button clicks, enabling smooth keyboard-based usage.
